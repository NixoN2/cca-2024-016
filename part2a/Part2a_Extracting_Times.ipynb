    "<b> Finding Normalized Execution Times </b><br>\n",
    "Divide the execution time with interference by execution time without interference for each workload-interference combination.<br>\n",
    "Round to 2 decimal places.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When measuring the performance of batch workloads, especially in the context of understanding slowdowns and multi-thread speedups on a cluster, both \"real time\" and \"user time\" provide valuable insights, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Time\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Real time, also known as \"wall-clock time,\" is the total elapsed time from the start to the completion of the workload. It includes all types of delays, such as waiting for I/O operations, waiting for other processes to execute, and actual CPU processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Real time is most useful when you want to measure the overall time a user has to wait for a task to complete. It's the most comprehensive measure of performance from an end-user perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Time\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: User time measures the CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process. This is the actual CPU time used in executing the process and does not include time spent waiting for I/O operations, or time spent executing other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: User time is particularly useful for understanding the CPU efficiency of the program. For multi-threaded applications, user time can exceed the real time since it accumulates CPU time across all threads. This makes it a key metric for assessing parallel efficiency and multi-thread speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining Slowdown and Multi-thread Speedup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Slowdown**: If you're looking to determine slowdown, real time is typically more relevant. It gives you a direct measure of how much longer a task takes under certain conditions compared to others. It reflects the total impact of all system and workload factors on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Multi-thread Speedup**: User time is more relevant when calculating multi-thread speedup because it allows you to assess how effectively the workload is utilizing the CPU resources, especially in parallel processing scenarios. Speedup is often calculated as the ratio of the execution time of the best sequential algorithm to the execution time of the parallel algorithm under analysis, considering only the CPU time used for computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "While user time is a critical metric for assessing the computational efficiency of a process, especially in parallel processing, real time gives you the complete picture of the end-to-end time taken, which includes all forms of waiting and processing. Thus, for comprehensive performance analysis, especially when considering multi-threaded applications on a cluster, it's beneficial to consider both metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To assess **multi-thread speedup**, focus on user time to understand CPU utilization and computational efficiency.\n",
    "- To understand the **overall impact on user experience** or system throughput, including all forms of delay, use real time."
